 * 1795. Rearrange Products Table
 * Table: Products
 * +-------------+---------+
 * | Column Name | Type    |
 * +-------------+---------+
 * | product_id  | int     |
 * | store1      | int     |
 * | store2      | int     |
 * | store3      | int     |
 * +-------------+---------+
 * product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
 * Each row in this table indicates the product's price in 3 different stores: store1, store2, and store3.
 * If the product is not available in a store, the price will be null in that store's column.
 * Write a solution to rearrange the Products table so that each row has (product_id, store, price).
 * If a product is not available in a store,
 * do not include a row with that product_id and store combination in the result table.
 * Return the result table in any order.
