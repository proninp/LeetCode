# 136. Single Number

Given a __non-empty__ array of integers `nums`, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

__Example 1:__
```
Input: nums = [2,2,1]

Output: 1
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]

Output: 4
```

__Example 3:__
```
Input: nums = [1]

Output: 1
```


__Constraints:__

* `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
* `-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104`
* Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
