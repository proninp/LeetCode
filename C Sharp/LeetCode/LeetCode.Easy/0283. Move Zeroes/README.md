# 283. Move Zeroes

Given an integer array `nums`, move all `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

__Note__ that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.


__Example 1:__
```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
```
