     * 2828. Check if a String Is an Acronym of Words
     * 
     * Given an array of strings words and a string s, determine if s is an acronym of words.
     * The string s is considered an acronym of words if it can be formed by concatenating the first character of each string in words in order.
     * For example, "ab" can be formed from ["apple", "banana"], but it can't be formed from ["bear", "aardvark"].
     * Return true if s is an acronym of words, and false otherwise.
